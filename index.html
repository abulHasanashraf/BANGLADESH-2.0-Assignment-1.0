            <p class="discription">Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and founder of Grameen Bank, has
                inspired millions with his quotes on social entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation. One of his notable
                quotes is: “Poverty is not created by poor people; poverty is created by the system, by the way we
                design our societies. Poor people are simply victims of that system." Yunus emphasizes that poverty is
                not a result of individual failure but rather a consequence of societal structures. He also said, “I
                believe that we can create a world of peace and dignity by providing opportunities for people to work
                together in harmony.” His vision calls for creating a world where everyone has access to the tools
                needed for success, particularly in empowering individuals through microfinance. Yunus advocates for
                social businesses designed to address social issues while remaining financially sustainable,
                transforming lives without exploiting others.</p>

                        government job quota system. Students and youth across the country have been demonstrating
                        against what they see as an unfair policy favouring a certain group - children of “freedom
                        fighters” in the Bangladesh war of independence. But after the government unleashed
                        unprecedented violence, the protests have gone beyond the demand for cancellation of the quota
                        system.</p>
